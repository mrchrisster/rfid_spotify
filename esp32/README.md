# Magical Alexa-Spotify-CD Box


For Christmas, I signed myself up for the "Creative Engineering with Mark Rober". As part of the class we have to build something with an Arduino. Here is my project. 

For my final project in the Creative Engineering with Mark Rober class, I submit to you my magic Alexa-Spotify-CD box. 
I just don't have the heart to throw out all my old CDs and thought this project might give them a second life. I took an 
esp32 microcontroller, hooked a RFID-RC522 reader to it, and wrote some code to read a Spotify link from NFC tags that I 
place on the CD cases and make a API call to Spotify to play that album on the Echo Dot that I mounted into a Walnut and 
Birdseye Maple case that I built.
