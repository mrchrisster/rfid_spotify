# Spotify RFID Player

## What is it?
**Tap a card and listen to a song on Spotify (like a Yoto just free)**  
This is a simple set of scripts to use a RFID-RC522 with a FriendlyELEC Nanopc-t4 or Raspberry Pi (I have an old Raspberry Pi 1b I use it with)



## Installation
  
- The easiest way to install SAM is launch `update_all.sh` menu, select "Tools & Scripts" and select "Mister Super Attract Mode". After running update_all, you will have a file called `MiSter_SAM_on.sh` in the Scripts folder. Run `MiSter_SAM_on.sh` and wait until SAM is fully installed/updated. You can configure SAM from the menu by running `MiSTer_SAM_on.sh` and pushing up.
